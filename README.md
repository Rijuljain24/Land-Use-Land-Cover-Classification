# Land Use Land Classification Using Machine Learning Algorithms and Remote Sensing

The very primary focus of the project is to create a Land use land cover map for a particular region of interest using a supervised machine learning algorithm in order to serve various purposes such as change detection in the land, planning and mapping to the land for various commercial and economical purposes etc.
In this phase of the project, we try to classify District Jammu (India) based on the CART algorithm of supervised machine learning using Google Earth Engine as the platform.











# Introduction
Land is a natural resource which is of finite nature and used for various purposes by the mankind. Thus, it becomes extremely crucial to utilize the land resource in a very sustainable and effective manner.

Land Use Land Cover classification plays a very important role in mapping as well as monitoring of land cover on earth’s surface.  The assesment of changes in LULC is one of the most effective ways to understand and manage the land transformation.

In this project, we intend to make use of a machine learning algorithms and data collected from remote sensing in order to classify land based on its use and cover. A brief introduction to machine learning algorithms and remote sensing is provided below.

LULC maps serve as quite useful methods in order to analyze the landscape composition and configuration, and also for detecting changes that must have been taking place in the landscape, as well as considering transformations with the environment gradients.
The recently discovered ML algorithms combined with the data from Remote Sensing help provide us an easier and accurate version of LULC map.

# Machine Learning and Remote Sensing



## Macine Learning
Algorithms that are involved in machine learning may be defined as mathematical procedures and techniques that allow computers to learn from data, identify patterns, make predictions, or perform tasks without the requirement of explicit programming. 
There are three main types of machine learning algorithms are mentioned below-

•	Supervised macine Learning Algorithms

Spurvised learning is, as the name suggests, an algorithm that requires external supervision to train and it serves the purpose of mapping input data with the output data.
Some examples of this technique include SVM (Support Vector Machine), RF(Random Forest) etc.
In this particular project we make use of just supervised machine learning model to classify land. However, the names of other two types of algorithms are also specified below.

•	Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms

•	Reinforcement machine Learning algorithms
## Cart Classifier

CART classifier works by creating tree-like structure conditions in order to decide which class every pixel is in. CART is like a variation of the decision tree algorithm. It can very well handle both classification and regression tasks.
## Remote Sensing

Remote Sensing can be referred to as the knowledge to acquire data, that usually consists of spatial data, without the need to physically visit the places. As of yet, there are many vehicles invented to do so, like satellites, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), drones, and many more. Remotely sensed data could be commonly used to support GIS analysis and also serve various other navigation and analyzing purposes.
For the purpose of this project, we make use of LANDSAT-8 satellite’s data that is remotely sensed.

# Google Earth Engine 

Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a user- friendly, open source and web based, very powerful cloud based computing tool that has recently and rightfully gained more and more attention in LULC. The advantage of using GEE as a platform for LULC classification includes parallel processing environment along with high volume of freely available LANDSAT/SENTINEL remote sensing data.
We use the Code Editor platform of the Google Earth Engine in order to carry out the classification.
